# How to write a great outline

You have an excellent idea for a technical blog post, but you don’t know how to get started? No problem — the “blank page syndrome” can easily be cured by a structured approach. Below is an example of how you can outline a blog post using an easy-to-follow structure.

## Intro

This is where you set the hook. Keep it short and to the point — but don’t be afraid to make it personal. Let’s say you’re writing a blog post about why you like a particular programming language, like Python for example. You can then start the intro with -”Roses are red and violets are blue — I love Python and soon you will too…..”.

Given that you only have a few seconds to convince your readers to stick around and read your post in its entirety, the intro is the place for a warm and welcoming tone.

## Main takeaways
Time to set expectations. A proven way to do this is to use a bulleted list that highlights the main takeaways for the reader. Consider the following example:

By reading this blog post you will learn:
- Why Python was created
- Why Python is more popular than ever before
- Why Python is beginner-friendly

Having a list of takeaways is a reader-friendly way to show your readers that you value their time, and that they will become one bit wiser when they have read your blog post. Spend time on perfecting this section — your readers will thank you.

## Technical background

One of the reasons why you are writing a technical blog post is because you are an expert. Your readers will most likely know far less about the subject than you. That’s why the “technical background” section is important. Use this section to give your readers a platform of knowledge to stand on. This section should also be used explain any “assumed knowledge”. You want readers to feel eager to learn — not stupid.

An example would be:

> ”To make the most of this blog post, you should be familiar with for-loops and lists...”

And don’t forget to link to any resources that can help your readers read up on what the need to know to understand your blog post.

## Explain how it’s done

This section is the meat and potatoes of any technical article. Take time to break down the path wisdom in sections — and there’s almost no such thing as too many sections. Organizing the content in sections will make it easy to skim through the blog post. This so that readers can cherry-pick the parts most relevant to them.

Create a full outline before you start drafting your blog post. Having a concrete outline will help you stay on track as you’re crafting your masterpiece. It’s easy to get lost in the details while explaining technical concepts. But if you make it a habit of glancing at your outline now and then, you will have no problem coming out alive on the other side.

An outline example could be:

- [ ] Why I love Python
- [ ] What you will learn today
- [ ] Prerequisites
- [ ] Python is a great language
  - [ ] The history of Python
  - [ ] The popularity of Python
  - [ ] A beginner-friendly choice
- [ ] Learning Python
  - [ ] For loops
    - [ ] Why loops are great
    - [ ] Write your first loop
    - [ ] Potential bugs
    - [ ] And how to fix them
  - [ ] Lists
    - [ ] Lists are great to keep track of stuff
    - [ ] Creating a list
    - [ ] Sorting a list
- [ ] Summary


## Summary

Tie it all together. This is the only section where it’s not only ok, but also encouraged, to be repetitive. Use the summary to stress the main takeaways from your blog post. Also, use this closing section to send the reader off to other relevant articles, blog posts, gists and so forth. Marketing people call this a Call To Action, or a CTA — but let’s just call it “a good link” for now.

Happy writing!
