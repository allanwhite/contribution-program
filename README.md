Become part of the Contentful community by contributing content on **"how to build better websites"**

## What is the Contentful contribution program?

The Contentful contribution program gives you a platform to share your ideas with the Contentful community and the rest of the world. Let it be a blog post, a video tutorial or something we can not even think of we want to hear from you and help you to create content that educates and inspires others to join the ["better way to build websites" movement](#what-does-building-better-websites-mean).

Our team of professional writers is there to support you to find the best words and Contentful will distribute your piece so that it reaches the right people.

As a thank you we also will send you **a 100$ Amazon voucher** and custom swag (socks anyone?) that proves that you are a community author.

## "I Don't know what to write about!"

Finding the right topic is hard â€“ we know that. Wether you would like to write for the Contentful blog but are not sure yet or are looking for some inspiration check out [the issues](https://github.com/contentful/contribution-program/issues) in this repository for a variety of topics we would like to see blog posts about. They are labeled by the respective technologies to allow easy filtering and searching.

## What does "building better websites" mean?

We believe that the future of the web is based on these areas:

- Static sites
- Serverless technologies
- Structured content (GraphQL)

If you have any questions about a certain topic or any suggestions, you are welcome to add a comment to the respective issue.

## How do I get started?

You got an idea what you want to write about and you are totally stoked to get started? Open a new issue or comment on an existing one and someone from **our developer relations team will reach out to you to discuss if your topic is a good fit**. If your topic is selected we move your story to [the project board](https://github.com/contentful/contribution-program/projects/1) and we will help you with everything you need.

Once you started writing, we'll make sure your topic is marked as `in progress` so that to avoid duplicated work.
